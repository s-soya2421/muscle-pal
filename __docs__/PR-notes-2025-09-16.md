Title: Align Supabase types, tighten image utils, and doc: switch to Supabase CLI

Summary
- Align app types to Supabase `Database` schema and export types from `@/types/supabase`.
- Apply `Database` generics to Supabase clients for end-to-end type safety.
- Harden image utils with strict typing and guards.
- Use `next/link` for bottom nav to unify SPA navigation.
- Docs: Add note about switching from Docker to Supabase CLI (honest rationale included).

Changes
- types: Replace ad-hoc `Post`/`Profile` with `@/types/supabase` across app/components.
- supabase: `createBrowserClient<Database>` and `createServerClient<Database>`.
- utils(image): `any` -> `unknown`, add object/array guards, precise MIME type checks.
- ui(nav): Anchor tags -> `Link` in bottom navigation.
- tests: Update mocks and prop types to match stricter typing.
- docs(README): Add section on Supabase CLI adoption and day-to-day commands.
 - challenges: Wire up Server Actions (`join/pause/resume/check-in`) and add core migrations for `post_images`, `challenge_participations`, `daily_progress`.
 - challenges (phase 2): Fetch real data for list, detail, progress and participants.
   - List: server-fetches `challenges` (active, not deleted), optional exclusive/locked via `get_accessible_challenges` RPC when authenticated.
   - Detail: server-fetches a single challenge by id.
   - Progress: server-fetches the current user's `daily_progress` and hydrates the calendar; check-in does optimistic update.
   - Participants: server-fetches `challenge_participations` + `profiles` (RLS-safe summary; no cross-user `daily_progress` reads).

Rationale
- Keep runtime data model aligned with DB schema to reduce drift and casting.
- Safer utils prevent subtle bugs from unexpected shapes (legacy vs. new image fields).
- `next/link` improves UX and consistency.
- CLI over Docker: Honestly, we were overcomplicating by not following the docs closely; the CLI is simpler and more cohesive for local dev.

Impact
- Minor UI copy/structure changes in post card (profile/like/workout details marked TODO for now).
- No breaking API changes; primarily internal typing and small presentational tweaks.
 - Challenge actions call Server Actions only on user interaction; normal navigation remains unaffected.
 - Participants streak shows `challenge_participations.current_day` (kept accurate by check-in updates). For cross-user longest streak, add a SECURITY DEFINER RPC later if needed.

How to Test
- Local env: `cp .env.local.example .env.local` and set Supabase envs.
- (Optional) Start Supabase: `npm run supabase:start` then `npm run supabase:reset`.
- Dev server: `npm run dev` and navigate to `/posts` and `/dashboard`.
- Run tests (locally): `npm run test:ci`.
 - Try challenges: `/challenges` â†’ open a detail page, click Join/Pause/Resume/Check-in.
 - Participants: On a detail page, verify top 10 participants render from `challenge_participations` (with `profiles` name/avatar).
 - Progress: Log in, check-in once; calendar marks completion and stats update (completed days, percentage, remaining days).

Follow-ups (nice to have)
- Add scripts: `types:gen:local` and integrate type gen after DB reset.
- Reconnect profile display/like-state/workout details to real data.
- CI: include `typecheck` + tests + optional `supabase gen types` validation.
 - Expand `get_user_badges` SQL to return more badge fields, or map in service as done now.
 - Add SECURITY DEFINER RPC for cross-user leaderboard metrics (e.g. longest streak) if RLS-safe aggregate is needed.
 - Add admin UI for challenge creation/edit, including `is_active` toggles and optional exclusive badge requirements.
