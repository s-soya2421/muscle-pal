Title: Align Supabase types, tighten image utils, and doc: switch to Supabase CLI

Summary
- Align app types to Supabase `Database` schema and export types from `@/types/supabase`.
- Apply `Database` generics to Supabase clients for end-to-end type safety.
- Harden image utils with strict typing and guards.
- Use `next/link` for bottom nav to unify SPA navigation.
- Docs: Add note about switching from Docker to Supabase CLI (honest rationale included).

Changes
- types: Replace ad-hoc `Post`/`Profile` with `@/types/supabase` across app/components.
- supabase: `createBrowserClient<Database>` and `createServerClient<Database>`.
- utils(image): `any` -> `unknown`, add object/array guards, precise MIME type checks.
- ui(nav): Anchor tags -> `Link` in bottom navigation.
- tests: Update mocks and prop types to match stricter typing.
- docs(README): Add section on Supabase CLI adoption and day-to-day commands.

Rationale
- Keep runtime data model aligned with DB schema to reduce drift and casting.
- Safer utils prevent subtle bugs from unexpected shapes (legacy vs. new image fields).
- `next/link` improves UX and consistency.
- CLI over Docker: Honestly, we were overcomplicating by not following the docs closely; the CLI is simpler and more cohesive for local dev.

Impact
- Minor UI copy/structure changes in post card (profile/like/workout details marked TODO for now).
- No breaking API changes; primarily internal typing and small presentational tweaks.

How to Test
- Local env: `cp .env.local.example .env.local` and set Supabase envs.
- (Optional) Start Supabase: `npm run supabase:start` then `npm run supabase:reset`.
- Dev server: `npm run dev` and navigate to `/posts` and `/dashboard`.
- Run tests (locally): `npm run test:ci`.

Follow-ups (nice to have)
- Add scripts: `types:gen:local` and integrate type gen after DB reset.
- Reconnect profile display/like-state/workout details to real data.
- CI: include `typecheck` + tests + optional `supabase gen types` validation.

PR Checklist
